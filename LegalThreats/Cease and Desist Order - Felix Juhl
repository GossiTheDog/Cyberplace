Cease and Desist Order

Dear Sir, 

In the name and on behalf of Felix Juhl, CEO of Artefaktum LLC, Boston, we hereby inform you of the following.

You are responsible for the following instance on Mastodon and its content:

cyberplace.social // @GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social

You are requested to irrevocably delete the following post(s) within 24 hours of receiving this email and not to make it accessible to any third party:

https://cyberplace.social/@shakal/109528246434459657

https://cyberplace.social/@shakal/109528248052241748

https://cyberplace.social/@shakal/109528249304498341

In the contributions, untrue facts are disseminated and statements damaging to reputation and honor are made, as well as untrue allegations damaging to credit are made accessible to third parties.

I hereby inform you that we will immediately and without objection file a criminal complaint against you with the public prosecutor's office in Manchester if this entry is not deleted immediately and irrevocably, as you then knowingly allow the dissemination of untrue defamatory and defamatory statements on your platform. We have already secured the entry so that it can be used in court and have filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt/Main against Mr. Marko Rogge for various criminally relevant offenses in this context.

After the Hold Security Issue (CASE #: 23-2-10303-3 SEA)  back in 2015 you should be aware that fake news and defamatory might lead to court suit and in this case at hand to criminal investigations.

Kind regards

Ian Watt, L.LM
